# Developing Data Products Course Project 
This repo contains my Shiny application and reproducible pitch for Coursera's Developing Data Products Course Project.

In this project, I created an app that predicts median sales prices of homes in Texas based on user input.

The Shiny application can be found at:

And the reproducible markdown presentation is published on RPubs at:
